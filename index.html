    <p>
      My first milonga in BA was at El Beso. Milonga de los Domingos. It's a classic one milonga with separate sitting
      of men and women. And I was a bit afraid at first. Organizer found me a place to sit and I started just watching
      because I was very interested in everything around me. The DJing was so good and of course I would like to dance.
      I choose several partners who I liked on the dancefloor on my list and tried to mirada on them. Yes, I had no
      conference in a result because I've heard lots of really different reviews about BA and I was ready for anything…
      But finally I've got a cabeceo! It was so amazing to dance at this place, you know. When you have heard about it
      and saw it on pictures but then one day you finally touch this floor by your shoes. Unbelievable! After this first
      tanda I got a real queue of men near my table to dance with me. And they were great! Everyone had a warm
      comfortable embrace and nice musicality. I was on this wave and very happy about everything happened to me. That's
      how BA met me. With music and a big hug.

      I asked my friend Michael where he will go, and he said La Parilla. We got know each other with Michael at
      marathon in SP, he is a great dancer and lives in BA for months, travels a lot, etc. But IDK why I wanted to join
      Salon Canning. I've heard a lot about this place and was very interested. So I went to Canning but it was rather
      empty because of Monday. Anyway I had a good time and knew some new people. Not every single experience was good
      but I get some compliments and one guy called me "Professora de baile". You know, it's pretty cool to hear smth
      like this when you are in a new place so finally I was happy and get some good tandas, one with a guy who invited
      me to his performance on Friday. I liked his musicality when we danced Tanturi tanda.

      My friend Aaron invited me to his milonga La YuYu. It was very comfortable for me: it finished at midnight and I
      have to get up very early the other day because my trip to Iguazu. I liked this milonga: free atmosphere, people
      just go to dance, nothing else, also I met Aaron who DJed, we danced and I liked it so much. I decided not to open
      every name in my story so some people would be called with letters in order of appearance. This evening I got
      great Biagi tanda with mister A with his amazing musicality, I never met someone with such an ear to music and at
      the same time an ability to express it with his body and with my body too. And I danced with mister B, who made
      something near mad but so good and other guys include one who performed this night. I didn't dance with one guy
      from Chile, he invited me after I changed and was going to leave. Pity, he seemed very energetic, but who
      cares…

      I had no idea which milonga to choose this Friday. You know, the app has a very big choice, especially for the
      person who is new in BA. But I've heard so much about La Viruta… That it's great and amazing milonga ever. So I
      decided to go there. In the corner of the block I lived in there was also a milonga, Oliverio and an announcement
      was about an orchestra with a woman singer. I said: why not? First I'll go there and after I'll go to La Viruta.
      But when I entered Oliverio it was a bit empty, no orchestra, not tango music, some people sitting at tables and
      people leaving the place… I thought: ok, I am late. But I've still got La Viruta! So I went there. It was about
      1am I reached the place. People who have ever been to La Viruta start to understand what I am talking about. I
      entered the club, it was for free, I saw a big crowd of people there, strange people let's say. There were no
      place to sit or at least to leave a bag but finally I found some spot. I felt very uncomfortable there IDK why… I
      didn't like the atmosphere, what I saw on the dancefloor, around, strange people coming to me and invited by hand…
      But I told myself: they said it's good milonga. Let's try. Finally, I danced with one guy. Milonga. Very, very
      bad. He was bad at everything. Embrace, musicality, navigation, communication… I started to think how to finish
      this tanda before 3 songs of etiquette but was a bit afraid of it. But after the second song this guy said: thank
      you, and I was so happy to be free again!!! Even when I realized that he "sitted" me. (Later I found out he did
      not because of the format of this milonga. It was milonga called "practica", so it's ok to finish when you want,
      no etiquette with 3-4 songs in tanda). But anyway, I was free. And I realized that I would not like any
      experiments for tonight, I want just to dance! So I left the best milonga for Salon Canning, which is 5min walk
      from the place. When I reached Canning I got happy! Good vibes, atmosphere, lots of people, good dancers, nice
      music and finally I danced great this night. And! Can you imagine? Some good partners who I danced with asked me:
      are you going to La Viruta after Canning? I answered with full of confidence: no! I was there, and I really didn't
      like it at all… And they told me that I made a mistake. La Viruta is great after 3-4 am on Friday and Saturday and
      it's incredible after 2-3 am on Wednesday and Sunday. WTF? Ok, after this wonderful night in Canning I think I can
      give the second chance to this Viruta. Let's go, it's 5-min walks and has free entrance! Around 5 am finally I am
      here. And what do you think? Amazing people, calm nice atmosphere, no crowd of strange people, good music and
      finally cool tandas. Yes! People were true. It's delicious milonga if you know how to cook it!

    <h3 class="w3-center">Fifth day. Saturday.</h3>
    <p>
      Today I asked Michael again if he joins any milonga because we have to dance before I leave. And he said: go to La
      Careta. I am not sure I searched very good but I didn't find this milonga in the app. So I asked for the link and
      said: ok, I'll go. Michael is a very good dancer so it's near impossible for him to recommend anything bad. Before
      this milonga I had my first tango class in BA. And I started from one of really great and long dancing tango
      maestra: Olga Besio. The lesson was on Spanish and about Canyenge but who cares? I went only to watch and touch
      such kind of maestra! Yes, I was inspired of her energy and the topic was rather unusual. At the end of the lesson
      people started to fill the place because of the following milonga here and I saw mister C: the best dancer of my
      previous night. I was happy to meet him again but rather disappointed that he will be here and I promised Michael
      to go to La Careta. But anyway we say hello to each other and some kind words. When I reached home after lesson I
      realized that I left my glasses case in the club… IDK why but I was so sad about it. Who knows why: because I was
      afraid I lost it forever or because I need to come back to the club and spend more time for this but I wanted to
      go to La Careta and wouldn’t like to miss the show of champions of Mundial de tango or because my coffee with cake
      were waiting for me at home, or maybe because of windy weather… But I was almost crying. And run to Club Fulgor
      for my glasses case. I found it easily, it was waiting for me on the table. After that I run home as fast as I
      can. Shower and taxi to La Careta. And!! WOW! At first, it was the cheapest milonga in case of ticket (except La
      Viruta with free entrance). The next thing: it was very crowded! But, come on, I have been to crowded milongas.
      What was the difference? Almost everybody danced good, or very good, or AMAZING! And the ronda was quite
      comfortable considering amount of people. A lot of young people! Before this night I danced a lot but an average
      age of my partners was rather imposing. The age is not a main factor in dancing for me, but I was a bit wonder
      where is the young dancers community? And finally I found it... OMG it was so incredible even to watch all these
      dancers, what did they do, how did they do, how did they look… Everything! And I thought ok, nobody will invite me
      here, they are too good for me. But fortunately people started to invite me to dance and every tanda was an
      unforgettable experience for me. How musical, how tender, how sensual they are. I should especially note one tanda
      with mister D, who had musicality like a God. We danced Troilo Rufino and it was incredible! And also the tanda of
      Tanturi valses with mister E which was so unbelievable. And DJIng… I loved every tanda I heard. And the show… They
      are real champions. I totally understood why. So clear by everything: technique, music, movements. And pure
      emotion and energy. They inspired me so much! I came back to life about 6 am when the last tanda was announced.
      Happy and tired. What was my feeling after all? Have just finished the best milonga in my life!
      P. S. What else I took out this night? Some things about what cabeceo is. It's not just watch to smb, and he
      invites you to dance and of course it's not like smb come to you and ask to dance with him. No. It's something
      more deep, more playful and more about a normal sympathy and interest to another person. First you look at smb.
      Just look, and see what happens. Another person looks at you. And if you have some interest to each other your
      view to each other continues. Then maybe you cannot hold back your smile. Let it happen. And other person will
      smile you back. That's not a cabeceo, it's not about pushing smth or have to do smth. It's only about saying: I am
      here, and I am opened to you. After some time at the right moment you both will dance with each other and explore
      more. But not right now.

      I can imagine how I was inspired after La Careta. I found out that there is another one milonga at the same place
      on Sunday: La milonguera comedia, of course I went there, it was no way. And it was less crowded but still so good
      by company that went to dance there. Very nice dancers. I should notice 2 dancers who I met here: mister F, who
      has a very nice embrace and a great musicality, and mister G, who is a cool person and also good dancer who said
      that I've got the most beautiful dress tonight and had tomorrow. I think I danced almost with everybody I wanted
      because of fewer people and after that I thought I would like to continue.
      And I remember what people told me about Sunday La Viruta! So at one moment I decided to go there. Take a bus and
      I am here again. Yes, La Viruta is a great milonga. Confirmed.

      La Viruta is great because of people. And yesterday I had an unexpected but so cool invitation for Corina de la
      Rosa lesson. Yes, I would like to join it for sure! But how difficult was it. She was teaching with her partner
      Alejandro, he is also great! They gave some exercises to train giros. And the main idea for me was: partner cannot
      move you, he can only move your legs. It's about being solid in your upper body and move in tango by legs, not to
      break your line. Also, one important thing was: to orientate to your partner, where he is and where he will be but
      not where it's more comfortable only for you to stand. Today I also had one more invitation to lesson by Gabriel
      Angio. It was at Salon Canning before the milonga. We joined it with mister A and I had a great experience
      learning some sequence and dancing it musically. You know, sometimes lesson becomes very useful because of your
      partner who is perfect dancer. It was my case with mister A. His musicality is incredible. After the lesson I
      supposed to dance in Canning but my friends said it would be few people there, so they let me join them to another
      milonga called Chupate esa Mandarina. People called it a hippie milonga. Young people, don't much care about the
      ronda, relaxed atmosphere. I danced a lot with my friends and some other people who came there. Interesting
      experience to join different milongas.

    <h3 class="w3-center">Eighth day. Tuesday.</h3>
    <p>
      I had an event in my Google Calendar to join Pancho lesson on Wednesday in his school Check to Check. But suddenly
      I saw a post in FB about his lesson at another place called Puro Cudra on Tuesday. I felt that I cannot wait
      anymore to see him: I have to skip last week lesson because of my visiting Iguazu, as you remember. So I took my
      shoes and went to Urda espacio cultural. I had no partner for that lesson, so I met him at the lesson, and he was
      good and gentle. And it was the first time I saw Pancho. Yes, I understand totally how great maestro he is. OMG so
      great. We learned some sequence and fixed problems with technique, communication, etc during this. The main idea
      Pancho and his partner Lorena gave me was to be more active in a couple and don't lose my own steps. The first
      thing Pancho showed on me was leading without hands: we walk together not because of embrace but because we would
      like to walk together. I liked the lesson because of the atmosphere, music and respect to students. The maestros
      were so open to us. After the lesson I joined Cachirulo milonga at El Beso. A lot of people recommended me this
      milonga because of great dancers and I thought to try. It was a classic one milonga where organizer chose a place
      for you to sit, men and women sit separately. I was impressed by organizer's energy! He is amazing person: meet
      people, chose them places to sit, if their no places, he starts to rearrange tables by himself, can stop the music
      if smb don't follow the rules, swears loudly! But IDK why I wasn't enjoying this milonga so much. I don't feel
      very comfortable there. At some moment Kate came to me (the Russian girl who lives in New Zealand now, we met at
      El Beso at my first night in BA), and said this is her second milonga for tonight, but she didn't satisfy at all.
      So she was going to take taxi to Salon Canning, maybe here she would be happy finally. I asked how much people she
      was going to take there, if there is a space for me in the car. She said: indeed! Me and my friend. Let's go! At
      the door we met our friend who was going to Canning too so the company of 4 people took an Uber with women driver
      and after 10 min we entered the place which was full of dancers and Juan D'Arienzo orchestra was about started
      their performance! Oh, that's why El Beso wasn't so good this night: almost everybody was in Canning for the
      orchestra! I don't like live music. Usually it's a fail. They play my favorite songs but much worse than the
      original. So I am always very careful about any milonga with live music. But this orchestra totally changed my
      mind! They are so cool! Music, energy, singer — everything is on the highest level. I was very inspired listening
      them and happy to danced by their music. The place was so crowded. It was difficult even to find a place where to
      put bags. I danced really a lot this night finally. So much different and great people. I first met mister H with
      his perfect musicality and soft and very comfortable embrace at this milonga. I left the milonga so tired and with
      pain in my feet, so I had to reject some cool invitations for dancing. It's unbelievable but this is true.

      Finally, Corina Herrera had found me by herself. I asked her about private lesson, but she was in tour and busy,
      so we didn't schedule it and I finished to worry about it, was near forget because life in BA was so full on
      events. But I received Corina's message yesterday: she said she was in BA finally, and we can arrange a lesson. So
      at 19 I was standing at the door by her house. She teaches at home at the big hall. There was a nice smell of
      indian chopsticks and muffled light, so I relaxed fast. She asked me if I have any questions and I said that I
      wish to improve my steps, my embrace, posture — all fundamental things. She said: let's dance first. After we
      danced she told me about 3 things: first one was about hips and feet, second was losing the connection sometimes
      and third was about pivots. She gave me some very useful recommendations about how feet work and about
      amortization more by feet than hip. Also, she asked to use her body more to have better connection and to be more
      direct in my movements. She showed me how to use dissociation in this case and it really helped me a lot. And we
      worked a bit on pivots and free leg. I need to pivot more than I did before and let my free leg be free and to
      feel each step, not to do it mechanically. The lesson was nice and full of information and further work for me.
      After we finished I needed some food and rest but had no time for that. Because recently I have senn the post at
      Milena Plebs' page about her lesson with Guillermo Barionuevo, and I was very interested at joining it. I invited
      my friend mister G to go together. He agreed, and we visited the lesson: it was about connection, feeling another
      person, how to lead and follow, how not to be so fixated on roles, so we changed our roles, I tried to lead, it
      was very difficult but exciting! Also, the pleasant part of the lesson was the pianist who played music for us! I
      tried to dance with different people: men, women, try to lead and follow. And I was very thankful for a woman who
      translated lesson for us: poor people who don't speak Spanish… I asked people where they will go to dance in the
      evening because I would love to go to La Viruta but I had no idea which place before? They said they will go to
      Porteño y Bailarin. When I reached home after my 2 lessons I felt a bit tired, so I didn't go to any milonga
      before but directly went to La Viruta at the right time. Horacio came back to BA, so I was going to catch his
      DJing). This night La Viruta was… IDK how to say. I never saw so many maestros at the same place. Yes, I saw AR
      maestros when they came to different festivals, to my city or another cities. But you know, they sit at the
      separate table, they almost never dance in a ronda, especially with other people at milonga. They are totally
      separated from “normal” people. But here they all went to spend some time with their friends, to drink, to dance,
      to talk, to laugh. So I saw them in their natural conditions. Like normal people. And yes, they are normal people
      but great! You can imagine how I was inspired to watch them dancing, to dance with some of them, or at least to
      dance in one ronda. It's unforgettable feeling. And it brings you smth so warm and pleasant inside, I think every
      person could immediately start to dance much better because of being close to such a great people. At least me. I
      was on fire this night! This night I saw mister I watching at me. Like I noticed before: it's not a cabeceo,
      invitation to dance but. The way to say: I am here and I know now you are here too.

      This was a date of Mario Morales lesson, the only day I could join it because last week I was at Iguazu and next
      week Mario was leaving to Moscow. So it was my chance to catch him. But something was against it IDK why. First I
      decided to go earlier and visit a museum before the lesson and went by metro but after 2 stations we were asked
      left carriages and train didn't go further. I went on the street but suddenly a huge queue appeared to buses. I
      thought ok, I'd better bought some fruits, come back home and go to the lesson directly later. But when later I
      went to the lesson also by metro (board at the entrance said all lines work normal), my line was delayed. It means
      train was standing on each station for several minutes… Finally, I reached Mario's school but was a bit late for
      the lesson. It was about musicality and very interesting: he showed us how to dance and listen to the music, that
      he never starts to dance immediately, he listens first like if he never has heard this music before, he feels it
      first. I liked Mario: he was so open, cheerful and had a big smile. After the lesson I needed to run to another
      lessons: Horacio! I wanted so much to join his lessons! He had 2: milonga and then tango. And it was an incredible
      experience. He was talking about musicality: in milonga, in tango, in making steps, ochos, whatever. It was so
      difficult to try to do this but it really opened our ears. And also watching Horacio dancing music — its pure
      happiness! Lessons were till midnight or a bit later. After them I practiced a bit in La Viruta and cannot find
      enough energy to go to any other milonga.

      I asked people where they are going to dance tonight. Some people told me they go to Pipi Cucu milonga, the great
      one but would be crowded because of the festival TIN which was taking place at different milongas every night.
      Other people said that the good option is to go to Dos Orillas and then Later Viruta. After some doubts I decided
      to go to Dos Orillas. It was good milonga but IDK why I didn't like it so much. I thought I should go to Pipi Cucu
      instead. But anyway, there were some interesting twists of fate: I met a very good partner there, mister J, with
      whom we continue to dance next several days very nice. We danced first at Dos Orillas, then I invited him to La
      Viruta. Also, I met my friend mister K with whom we met first at La Careta, and we would love to meet and dance
      again.
      La Viruta was very strong test for me this day. It gave me some lessons but not tango. But this story beyonds the
      scope of these notes. So, I can say this Friday was emotionally very difficult for me. And not only for me, its
      difficult day for all of us… Because of Julio… I danced Pugliese for my last tanda this night and left in
      confusion and semi-crying.

      No way! Saturday for me mean La Comedia tango! This day it wasn't La Careta but festival milonga, but the same
      great people were there, nice show, live music a bit: interesting orchestra El Cachivache Quinteto, unusual sound
      and variations. I really liked to dance by this orchestra from first to the last songs. La Comedia Tango is a
      magical place: you come back to reality only at 6 am when DJ announces the last 2 tandas. Love this place and
      energy and snacks with cola at the end of the party.

    <p>
      TIN lessons by Corina Herrera and Ines Muzzopappa about changing roles in tango. Yes, in BA at lessons we changed
      roles a lot. And it really helps! To understand what partner feels, how to make our dancing more comfortable and
      trying another role also helps to improve your usual role. I like this lesson and the girls, they are amazing. I
      tried to lead and it was so exciting! I would like to continue my experience. After lesson, I had a nap and went
      to the festival milonga to La Cathedral. My friend told me that I have to visit this place, that it's so unusual.
      Yes, the place is really not like anything else. Lots of art, old furniture, heart hanging from the ceiling, few
      light. Strange place with strange atmosphere. Truly, I didn't feel comfortable there. I thought about watching
      Corina Herrera's show and move to La Viruta. I almost lost my glasses there: I left them at the bar for a tanda,
      and they magically disappeared… I was searching for them at the bar, under the bar, everywhere… Asked the barman,
      but he didn't speak English. I was near despair when one guy came to me and asked if I lost my glasses case. I
      said: yes! He told me to ask the barman but I told he didn't speak English. The guy said: wait! Then he said smth
      to the barman, the barman asked another barman, and he gets my glasses from their shelves, and he said everything
      people left at the bar except drinks they put at the bar's shelves. I was so happy to found my glasses! Then there
      was a show by Corina Herrera and Ines Muzzopappa, the girls are great and funny, like them so much! Then was live
      music by Chino Laborde, we danced all of it with mister J who is a big fan of live music, so we enjoyed it very
      much! After that I had more good tandas, the best 2 were Tanturi Campos with mister H and Pugliese with mister F.
      Some magic started to happen. Mister H came to me to talk a bit, we discussed smth, and then he said: I came just
      to save you to the next tanda. That was soooooo cute and amazing! Also, he asked: which music would you like to
      dance now? I remembered that Pugliese and Troilo already have been recently so as an answer was my 3rd fav
      orchestra: Tanturi. And after several moments Tanturi Campos began… It was one of the best tandas of my life.
      Really. I thought about going to La Viruta after La Cathedral, but I was so tired and tomorrow I had lessons with
      Olga Besio. So I decided to go home to sleep a bit.

      Olga Besio did some magic with us. At the beginning it was a bit difficult to find a place where lesson should be.
      Teatro La Comedia. I knew this is the La Careta milonga place. But… There were 2 non dancing guys in the hall, and
      they are not supposed to join the class. But the address was ok. I started to chat with organizers of the festival
      to check the address and finally saw Gaston at the street looking for lost students. The lessons were directly in
      the theatre. At the scene. Olga is a really great teacher and person. It was a class for tango teachers. I am not
      a teacher but anyway, I would love to know which things are supposed to be told students at the first tango
      lesson. And Olga told us. This is 2 things: we dance with other person, and we dance music. Simple? But honestly
      these things are missing by so many teachers and tango dancers. The main things in tango. Olga made us hug each
      other, made us walk musically, made us feel other person… She said teacher should allow to do these things with
      students don't telling directly to do these things. Make these things happen by itself. This is the magic, magic
      to be a teacher. I was so excited by her! She is all about energy, music and embrace. I was very tired after the
      weekend: dancing, lessons, shows, activities, so I went to take a nap after lesson and was going to dance tonight
      at Muy Lunes. But when I got up at 9pm I realized that I will die if I'll go anywhere… I decided that I can skip
      Monday (hard decision anyway) but then to dance every single day. And I slept this night, yes.
    </p>

    <h3 class="w3-center">Fifteenth day. Tuesday.</h3>
    <p>
      There was another one reason to sleep last night: I have to be awake on Tuesday. This was the day X, let's say:
      private lesson with Pancho. He is a great teacher: professional, polite, accurate. I told him about some problems
      I would like to fix and things I'd like to improve, and he found an exact and clear way to close one big question
      in my dancing: how to be together, to keep the connection, embrace but at the same time to be myself. We work a
      lot by standing leg, by posture, by how to step, how to feel the partner, how to embrace… We worked with my body
      and try to found the best way to dance for me. But let me tell you something to understand the situation more.
      When I went to the dance studio where the lesson would take place in I noticed a lot of shops I would like to
      visit to buy some things, I said myself: ok, I don't do it before the lesson because of lack of time but after I
      have to visit all these shops! And what do you think? When I went to the street after lesson I hardly could
      remember anything before it… And I really cannot remember how I got home after the lesson… It was a real magic
      happened to me. I just remember that it was a very hot day and I wore my red dress. When I finally reached home, I
      decided to try Cachirulo in El Beso this evening again. This time was more successful let's say but anyway IDK why
      I didn't feel myself very comfortable at this milonga. I danced and danced good, with great dancers but maybe it's
      another energy who knows… And also another thing maybe disturbed me. I was thereafter the lesson that changed me
      and my tango a lot. So something changed in my mind and my body started to change too. At the beginning it's
      rather difficult to relax and dance good after such a brain explosion. But I knew that finally I will be better
      dancer than I was before.
      It was a funny moment when suddenly music in the middle of the tanda music stopped and organizer went to the
      dancefloor and started to swear to the ronda: “You are not allowed to do boleos here! We dance in the floor! On
      the floor! No boleos! This is not La Viruta!” Yes, he was right! But WTF who can did anything like boleo in such a
      crowd! Really crazy people. And yes, if there are rules at milonga you should follow them. If you don't feel you
      would like to follow the rules — there are a lot of other milongas which are not so strict. About 3 am organizer
      announced the last tanda. I started to change my shoes but after last tanda a new one tanda began. I asked my
      friend mister L what happened, and he answered that's because organizer pushes everyone to the dancefloor and not
      to sit. But the mood wasn't to continue to dance there, so we decided to move to Canning. I really love Canning's
      atmosphere: it's quite simple but always like a fiesta, celebration. Maybe because the hall is big and has much
      air, maybe because of colors, light but I always had a solemn mood when I cross the threshold of this place. I had
      a really great tandas there with mister L, I loved the music and I met my friends there, especially I was very
      glad to see mister H. There was not much people but I cheered up there and relaxed. Like my friend mister L said
      after this milonga: it's great that we decided to live these 2 hours. We didn't go home after El Beso but went to
      Canning to live much more. Yes, it was a turning point of my adventure. This day I decided to live and be happy.
      It was the last week of my vacation in BA and I just let myself do what my heart was asking for and what my soul
      wanted and I really made a decision. To live now, to follow my way and my intuition.

    <h3 class="w3-center">Sixteenth day. Wednesday.</h3>
    <p>
      It was a lot of shopping this day, I really run from one place to another, buying shoes, tops, souvenirs, I had a
      great mood. The day was so sunny and hot! I was a bit near a heatstroke or sunstroke I suppose because at some
      time I didn't feel myself very good. But after some delicious food and a swimming pool I fully recovered and was
      ready to run to Cheek to Check dance studio. I put my new Soy Porteña shoes in my bag and put on my black dress
      with a silver cord on my back. I was on fire these evening! I reached c2c studio about midnight I suppose. There
      were not very much people but almost all were good dancers. Also, there was a concert with a tango band with a
      nice singer. I liked their performance so much! Only one thing was not so good this evening: I lost my hairpin
      there. I left it at one of the tables and when came back after a great tanda I cannot find my hairpin anymore. But
      as my friend says: sometimes we “pay” for something good in our life with some stuff or money we lose. So my
      hairpin was a very small price for things happened at this milonga. I had Great tandas with mister I, mister M and
      other guyes too. WTF, why I have never been there before? There was funny moment: I met mister N, who I knew by
      the Kraków marathon, he is from Italy and went to BA to dance. It's great to meet some people you know when you
      are so far from home and so far from other places you have been visited. BA is a meeting point for great dancers
      by every corner of the world. We all will be here one day.
      One thing I also find amazing: to rush to La Viruta by the car after Cheek to Cheek. All people who want to
      continue embrace each other gather at La Viruta after different milongas. This is a real place of power.

    <h3 class="w3-center">Seventeenth day. Thursday.</h3>
    <p>
      Thursday means Horacio lessons! I was waiting for them because it's a real magic he made with us. This day he also
      breaks our brains with his incredible musicality: in milonga, in tango. We tried to do what he asked and our ears
      got open more and more and our bodies got happier dancing musical. I really love Horacio with his explosive energy
      and his ability to make students' eyes burning because of pleasure of new knowledge. I have to skip milonga De
      Querusa which one was recommended me by friends but Horacio lessons were very important for me, so I decided to go
      to other milonga where people usually go after De Querusa: En Lo de Balmaceda at La Nacional. I caught a bus which
      goes from La Viruta to La Nacional. I entered the place directly when organisers started to play video about Julio
      Balmaceda. The milonga was in memory of him. This night his brother Ernesto was GJing, and I was really inspired
      by his energy and positive vibes. He is a great person! The music was very nice, and he made a pleasant and warm
      mood to people. I felt very comfortable, like if I'd been at home near the fireplace. Also, I was glad to
      congratulate my friend mister H with his birthday which he was celebrating at the milonga. Champagne, small
      fireworks, Di Sarli Duran… Everything made me happy this night. There was raining when I left the place. But if
      the rain can stop a dancer who is happy this night?

    <h3 class="w3-center">Eighteenth day. Friday.</h3>
    <p>
      Tonight it would be Pipi Cucu, no way, I need to try it. I skipped 2 times for some strange reasons but tonight is
      the last Friday of this trip soooooo!!!
      I found out this is the same place where yesterday's milonga was: La Nacional. And IDK why I thought it starts at
      11pm. When I reached the place I realized that I am too early, because it starts at 11:50. As I was very hungry I
      decided to use this time to eat smth. I found one café with high rating and went there but there was a big queue
      at the door waiting to be sitted… So I started to find another place nearby. After walking 2 or 3 blocks I found a
      small cute place which has several tables. I entered and opened a menu. And WOW!!! Finally, I found soups in
      Buenos Aires!! That was a big luck! I ordered one with seafood and it was delicious and the plate was enormous as
      always here. I hardly finished a half of this nice dish and was really full. And it was the time to go to Pipi
      Cucu! This is a true that milonga is made by organisers. And in BA you can really understand what it means.
      Because some milongas made by different organisers take place at the same halls but the atmosphere and even what
      the place looks like is changing cardinally. Tonight there was another light, another colors than yesterday, and
      atmosphere was totally different but also great! A lot of great dancers, nice music, almost unstoppable dancing.
      At one moment my feet hurted so much that I decided to change my shoes. I sitted 5 min without shoes and it was a
      paradise. Then I changed to lower heels and continue dancing because everything was great and it would be
      unforgivable to stop. I met a dancer with incredible energy this night: mister O. He was very sad to know that
      this was my last weekend here, in BA.
      Also, I finally met mister P with whom we would like to dance at my first La Careta milonga, but we were dancing
      with other people and only after milonga realized that didn't dance, so we decided to do it at the next milongas,
      but he magically had disappeared. But he was finally here, at Pipi Cucu, so we danced and it was awesome!
      When we left the place with my friend mister H after milonga finished it already has been a morning, a bit cold
      but sunny.
      We went to the metro very slowly because of the pain in our feet, but we were very happy.
